## Lab 11 - Deployment & CI/CD

This lab focuses on deployment of ML models and building continuous integration (CI)
and continuous deployment (CD) pipelines for that purpose. Those operations allow safe,
automated and efficient updates of models to production environment.

We will use GitHub Actions for implementing CI/CD pipelines due to their simplicity and
popularity. Prior to deployment itself, we will use ONNX tools to compile and optimize
our model. And AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) for deployment configuration and execution.

**Learning Plan**
1. GitHub Actions workflows
2. CI/CD pipelines for Python applications
3. ONNX format and runtime
4. Lightweight Docker images for ML inference
5. AWS SAM for model deployment

**Necessary software**
- AWS account
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
